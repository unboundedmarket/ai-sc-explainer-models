It is part of a larger project, likely related to a decentralized application (dApp) or a specific use case involving token management or staking. The script is intended to move funds to a staked address. Let's break down the code in detail:\n\n### Imports\n\n1. **Standard Libraries:**\n   - `datetime`: Not used in the provided code, but typically used for handling date and time operations.\n   - `fire`: A library for automatically generating command-line interfaces (CLIs) from Python functions.\n\n2. **Cardano Libraries:**\n   - `pycardano`: A library for interacting with the Cardano blockchain, providing tools for building and submitting transactions.\n   - `opshin.prelude`: Contains utility functions and types for working with Cardano smart contracts.\n\n3. **Project-Specific Imports:**\n   - `uada.onchain.uada`: Likely contains on-chain logic or contract definitions specific to the project.\n   - `uada.utils.network`: Contains utility functions for network interactions, such as displaying transactions and getting context.\n   - `uada.utils.to_script_context`: Provides functions for converting data to a script context, such as addresses.\n   - `uada.utils`: Contains various utility functions and constants used throughout the project.\n   - `uada.utils.contracts`: Functions related to contract management.\n\n### Utility Functions and Constants\n\n- **`token_from_string`, `asset_from_token`, `module_name`, `with_min_lovelace`, `sorted_utxos`, `amount_of_token_in_value`, `SAMPLE_STAKE_KEY`, `combine_with_stake_key`:** These are utility functions and constants imported from the project's utility module. They likely handle token parsing, asset management, and address manipulation.\n\n### Main Function\n\nThe `main` function is the core of the script, performing the following steps:\n\n1. **Get Payment Address:**\n   - `get_signing_info`: Retrieves the signing information for a given wallet, including the verification key (`vkey`), signing key (`skey`), and payment address. The `network` parameter specifies which Cardano network to use (e.g., mainnet or testnet).\n\n2. **Combine with Stake Key:**\n   - `combine_with_stake_key`: Combines the payment address with a stake key to create a staked address. This is useful for delegating funds to a stake pool.\n\n3. **Build the Transaction:**\n   - `TransactionBuilder`: Initializes a transaction builder with the current blockchain context.\n   - `context.utxos(payment_address)`: Retrieves unspent transaction outputs (UTxOs) associated with the payment address.\n   - `builder.add_input(u)`: Adds each UTxO as an input to the transaction.\n\n4. **Sign the Transaction:**\n   - `builder.build_and_sign`: Builds the transaction and signs it using the provided signing key. The `change_address` is set to the combined address, ensuring any leftover funds are returned to the staked address.\n\n5. **Submit the Transaction:**\n   - `context.submit_tx(signed_tx)`: Submits the signed transaction to the Cardano network.\n   - `show_tx(signed_tx)`: Displays the transaction details, likely for logging or debugging purposes.\n\n### Command-Line Interface\n\n- `fire.Fire(main)`: Uses the `fire` library to create a command-line interface for the `main` function, allowing users to run the script with different parameters from the command line.\n\n### Summary\n\nThis script is designed to automate the process of moving funds from a wallet to a staked address on the Cardano blockchain. It retrieves necessary signing information, constructs a transaction using available UTxOs, signs the transaction, and submits it to the network. The use of utility functions and libraries like `pycardano` simplifies interaction with the blockchain, while `fire` provides an easy way to run the script with different configurations.", "file_path": "uada-contracts/uada/offchain/move_to_staked.py", "file": "move_to_staked.py"}

It uses the `pycardano` library to handle key generation and address creation. Here's a detailed breakdown of the code:\n\n### Imports\n\n- **`Path` from `pathlib`**: Used for handling filesystem paths in a way that is compatible across different operating systems.\n- **`click`**: A package for creating command-line interfaces. It simplifies argument parsing and command execution.\n- **`pycardano`**: A library for interacting with the Cardano blockchain. It provides classes for creating addresses and handling keys.\n\n### Key Directory\n\n- **`keys_dir`**: This is a `Path` object pointing to a directory named `keys` located two levels up from the current file's directory. This is where the generated keys and addresses will be stored.\n\n### Main Function\n\nThe `main` function is decorated with `@click.command()` and `@click.argument(\"name\")`, which means it can be executed from the command line with a single argument, `name`. This argument is used to name the generated files.\n\n#### Functionality\n\n1. **Directory Creation**: \n   - `keys_dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)`: Ensures that the `keys` directory exists. If it doesn't, it creates it. The `exist_ok=True` parameter prevents an error if the directory already exists.\n\n2. **File Paths**:\n   - Constructs paths for the signing key (`.skey`), verification key (`.vkey`), mainnet address (`.addr`), and testnet address (`.test_addr`) using the provided `name`.\n\n3. **File Existence Check**:\n   - Checks if any of the files already exist. If they do, it raises a `FileExistsError` to prevent overwriting existing keys or addresses.\n\n4. **Key Generation**:\n   - **Signing Key**: `PaymentSigningKey.generate()` creates a new signing key.\n   - **Save Signing Key**: `signing_key.save(str(skey_path))` saves the signing key to a file.\n\n5. **Verification Key**:\n   - **Derive Verification Key**: `PaymentVerificationKey.from_signing_key(signing_key)` derives the verification key from the signing key.\n   - **Save Verification Key**: `verification_key.save(str(vkey_path))` saves the verification key to a file.\n\n6. **Address Creation**:\n   - **Mainnet Address**: `Address(payment_part=verification_key.hash(), network=Network.MAINNET)` creates a mainnet address using the hash of the verification key.\n   - **Save Mainnet Address**: Writes the mainnet address to a file.\n\n7. **Testnet Address**:\n   - **Testnet Address**: `Address(payment_part=verification_key.hash(), network=Network.TESTNET)` creates a testnet address.\n   - **Save Testnet Address**: Writes the testnet address to a file.\n\n8. **Output**:\n   - Prints the paths of the generated files to the console, confirming their creation.\n\n### Execution\n\n- The script is designed to be run as a standalone program. The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block ensures that `main()` is called when the script is executed directly.\n\n### Summary\n\nThis script is a utility for generating cryptographic keys and addresses for the Cardano blockchain. It ensures that files are not overwritten and provides both mainnet and testnet addresses, which are essential for testing and deployment in different network environments. The use of `click` makes it user-friendly for command-line execution.", "file_path": "muesliswap-onchain-governance/muesliswap_onchain_governance/create_key_pair.py", "file": "create_key_pair.py"}

Specifically, this script is designed to handle the transformation of empty dictionary constructs into a form that can be understood by the Cardano blockchain's execution environment, known as UPLC (Untyped Plutus Core).\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown of the code:\n\n### Imports\n\n- **re**: Regular expressions module, though not used in the provided code snippet.\n- **copy**: Provides the `copy` function, which is also not used in this snippet.\n- **Optional**: A type hint from the `typing` module, not used here.\n- **Enum**: A base class for creating enumerations, not used in this snippet.\n- **CompilingNodeTransformer**: A custom class likely defined elsewhere in the project, used as a base class for transforming nodes in an abstract syntax tree (AST).\n- **Typed AST components**: These are imported from `..typed_ast`, which suggests a custom implementation of an abstract syntax tree with type annotations.\n\n### Class: `RewriteEmptyDicts`\n\nThis class inherits from `CompilingNodeTransformer`, indicating that it is designed to traverse and transform nodes in an AST.\n\n- **Purpose**: The class is specifically designed to replace empty dictionary constructs in the AST with a UPLC representation of empty data pairs. This is necessary because the execution environment on Cardano (UPLC) does not natively understand high-level constructs like Python dictionaries.\n\n- **`step` attribute**: This is a descriptive string that likely serves as a label or identifier for this transformation step in a larger compilation process.\n\n### Methods\n\n#### `visit_Dict(self, node: TypedDict)`\n\n- **Purpose**: This method is called when the transformer encounters a dictionary node in the AST.\n- **Logic**:\n  - It checks if the dictionary (`node`) has any keys or values.\n  - If the dictionary is not empty (i.e., it has keys or values), it returns the node unchanged.\n  - If the dictionary is empty, it transforms the node into a `RawPlutoExpr` with a UPLC expression representing an empty pair of data (`plt.MkNilPairData(plt.Unit())`).\n\n#### `visit_Constant(self, node: TypedConstant)`\n\n- **Purpose**: This method is called when the transformer encounters a constant node in the AST.\n- **Logic**:\n  - It checks if the constant value is an empty dictionary (`{}`).\n  - If the constant is not an empty dictionary, it returns the node unchanged.\n  - If the constant is an empty dictionary, it transforms the node into a `RawPlutoExpr` with the same UPLC expression for an empty pair of data.\n\n### UPLC Representation\n\n- **`RawPlutoExpr`**: This is likely a class that wraps a UPLC expression, allowing it to be used in the transformed AST.\n- **`plt.MkNilPairData(plt.Unit())`**: This is a UPLC expression that represents an empty pair of data. `plt` is presumably a module or namespace that provides functions and constants for constructing UPLC expressions.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe `RewriteEmptyDicts` class is a transformation utility that ensures empty dictionaries in the high-level smart contract code are correctly represented in the UPLC format. This transformation is crucial for the correct execution of smart contracts on the Cardano blockchain, as it bridges the gap between high-level constructs and the low-level execution environment.", "file_path": "opshin/opshin/rewrite/rewrite_empty_dicts.py", "file": "rewrite_empty_dicts.py"}

The code is written in Python and uses several libraries, including `pycardano` for interacting with the Cardano blockchain, and `fire` for creating command-line interfaces. Let's break down the code step by step:\n\n### Imports\n\n- **fire**: A library for creating command-line interfaces.\n- **pycardano**: A library for interacting with the Cardano blockchain.\n- **muesliswap_onchain_governance.utils.network**: Contains utility functions for network interactions.\n- **opshin.ledger.api_v2**: Provides types like `POSIXTime`.\n- **opshin.prelude**: Provides utility types like `Token`.\n- **pycardano**: Provides classes for building transactions, such as `TransactionBuilder`, `Redeemer`, `AuxiliaryData`, etc.\n- **muesliswap_onchain_governance.onchain.staking**: Contains staking-related on-chain logic.\n- **muesliswap_onchain_governance.onchain.tally**: Contains tally-related logic.\n- **muesliswap_onchain_governance.utils**: Provides utility functions for signing, network configuration, and contract management.\n\n### Main Function\n\nThe `main` function is the entry point of the script. It performs the following tasks:\n\n1. **Load Script Info**: \n   - Retrieves the staking contract script, its address, and other related information using `get_contract`.\n\n2. **Get Payment Address**:\n   - Retrieves the payment verification key, signing key, and address for the specified wallet using `get_signing_info`.\n\n3. **Find Staking UTXO**:\n   - Iterates over UTXOs at the staking address to find one that matches the user's address and contains the governance token.\n   - Uses `staking.StakingState.from_cbor` to deserialize the datum from CBOR format.\n   - Checks if the UTXO belongs to the user and contains the governance token using `amount_of_token_in_value`.\n\n4. **Prepare Transaction Inputs**:\n   - Collects all UTXOs from the user's payment address and the identified staking UTXO.\n   - Sorts these UTXOs using `sorted_utxos`.\n\n5. **Create Redeemer**:\n   - Constructs a `Redeemer` object for withdrawing funds from the staking contract.\n   - Specifies the index of the staking UTXO in the list of all UTXOs.\n\n6. **Build the Transaction**:\n   - Initializes a `TransactionBuilder` with the current blockchain context.\n   - Adds inputs from the user's payment UTXOs.\n   - Adds the staking UTXO as a script input with the staking script and redeemer.\n   - Sets auxiliary data with metadata indicating the transaction's purpose (\"Close Staking Position\").\n   - Creates a transaction output to return funds to the staking address with a minimum amount of Lovelace.\n\n7. **Sign the Transaction**:\n   - Builds and signs the transaction using the user's signing key.\n   - Specifies the change address to return any leftover funds.\n\n8. **Submit the Transaction**:\n   - Submits the signed transaction to the blockchain using `context.submit_tx`.\n   - Displays the transaction details using `show_tx`.\n\n### Command-Line Interface\n\nThe script uses `fire.Fire(main)` to create a command-line interface, allowing users to execute the `main` function with different parameters, such as specifying a different wallet.\n\n### Summary\n\nThis script is designed to close a staking position on the Cardano blockchain by interacting with the MuesliSwap on-chain governance system.

Here's a detailed breakdown:\n\n1. **Initialize Governance Tokens**:\n   - `init_gov_tokens` is called to initialize governance tokens for the voter. It uses the voter's wallet name, the governance token name, and an amount of 1,000,000 tokens.\n   - `wait_for_tx(init_tk_tx)` waits for the transaction to complete, ensuring the tokens are initialized before proceeding.\n\n2. **Initialize Governance State**:\n   - `init_gov_state` sets up the initial state for governance. It requires the creator's wallet name, the governance token, minimum quorum, and minimum proposal duration.\n   - The function returns a transaction and a governance NFT name, which are used in subsequent steps.\n   - `wait_for_tx(creation_tx)` ensures the governance state is initialized before moving on.\n\n3. **Create Tally**:\n   - `create_tally` is called to create a tally for a governance proposal. It requires the creator's wallet name, the governance state NFT token name, and the treasury benefactor's wallet name.\n   - The function returns a transaction and a tally state.\n   - `wait_for_tx(tally_tx)` ensures the tally is created before proceeding.\n\n4. **Initialize Staking**:\n   - `init_staking` initializes staking for the voter. It requires the voter's wallet name, the governance token, the amount to be locked (1,000 tokens), and the tally authorization NFT token name.\n   - `wait_for_tx(staking_tx)` ensures the staking is initialized before adding a vote.\n\n5. **Add Vote to Tally**:\n   - `add_vote_tally` is called to add a vote to the tally. It requires the voter's wallet name, the proposal ID from the tally state, the proposal index (0 in this case), and the tally authorization NFT token name.\n   - `wait_for_tx(added_tally_tx)` ensures the vote is added to the tally.\n\n### Summary\n\nThis test function simulates a complete workflow for adding a vote to a governance proposal tally in the MuesliSwap on-chain governance system. It involves initializing tokens, setting up governance state, creating a tally, initializing staking, and finally adding a vote. Each step involves a transaction, and the `wait_for_tx` function ensures that each transaction is completed before proceeding to the next step. This ensures the test runs smoothly and accurately reflects the real-world process on the Cardano blockchain.", "file_path": "muesliswap-onchain-governance/test/offchain/tally/test_add_vote.py", "file": "test_add_vote.py"}

This code defines two main components: `pAlwaysFails` and `pAuthMint`. Let's break down each part of the code:\n\n### Module and Imports\n\n```haskell\nmodule AlwaysFails (pAlwaysFails, pAuthMint) where \n\nimport Plutarch.Prelude\nimport Plutarch.Api.V2 \nimport PriceDiscoveryEvent.Utils (pvalueOfOne)\n```\n\n- **Module Declaration**: The module is named `AlwaysFails` and it exports two functions: `pAlwaysFails` and `pAuthMint`.\n- **Imports**:\n  - `Plutarch.Prelude`: Provides basic Plutarch functionality and types.\n  - `Plutarch.Api.V2`: Contains API definitions for Plutarch, including transaction and script context types.\n  - `PriceDiscoveryEvent.Utils (pvalueOfOne)`: Imports a utility function `pvalueOfOne` from another module, which is presumably used to check the value of a specific token.\n\n### `pAlwaysFails` Function\n\n```haskell\npAlwaysFails ::\n  ClosedTerm PValidator\npAlwaysFails  = plam $ \\_dat _redmn _ctx' -> popaque $ perror\n```\n\n- **Type**: `ClosedTerm PValidator` indicates that this is a validator script.\n- **Functionality**: \n  - `plam`: Defines a Plutarch lambda function.\n  - The function takes three parameters: `_dat`, `_redmn`, and `_ctx'`, which represent the datum, redeemer, and script context, respectively.\n  - `popaque $ perror`: This line makes the function always fail by using `perror`, which is a Plutarch function that causes the script to fail unconditionally. `popaque` is used to wrap the error in an opaque term, which is a common pattern in Plutarch to handle terms that should not be evaluated further.\n\n### `pAuthMint` Function\n\n```haskell\npAuthMint ::\n  Term s (PAsData PCurrencySymbol :--> PMintingPolicy)\npAuthMint  = plam $ \\multisigCert _redmn ctx ->\n  let inputs = pfield @\"inputs\" # (pfield @\"txInfo\" # ctx) \n   in pif (pany @PBuiltinList\n            # plam (\\inp -> (pvalueOfOne # multisigCert # (pfield @\"value\" # (pfield @\"resolved\" # inp)))) \n            # inputs)\n          (popaque $ pconstant ())\n          perror\n```\n\n- **Type**: `Term s (PAsData PCurrencySymbol :--> PMintingPolicy)` indicates that this is a minting policy script.\n- **Functionality**:\n  - The function takes three parameters: `multisigCert`, `_redmn`, and `ctx`.\n    - `multisigCert`: A currency symbol wrapped in `PAsData`, which is likely used to identify a specific token or certificate.\n    - `_redmn`: The redeemer, which is not used in this function.\n    - `ctx`: The script context, which contains transaction information.\n  - `inputs = pfield @\"inputs\" # (pfield @\"txInfo\" # ctx)`: Extracts the list of transaction inputs from the transaction info within the context.\n  - `pany @PBuiltinList`: Checks if any input in the list satisfies a given condition.\n    - The condition is defined by the lambda function `plam (\\inp -> ...)`, which checks if the value of the resolved input contains the specified `multisigCert` using `pvalueOfOne`.\n  - `pif`: A conditional expression that executes the first branch if the condition is true, otherwise executes the second branch.\n    - If the condition is true (i.e., the multisig certificate is found in the inputs), it returns `popaque $ pconstant ()`, which represents a successful execution.\n    - If the condition is false, it calls `perror`, causing the script to fail.\n\n### Summary\n\n- **`pAlwaysFails`**: A validator script that always fails, regardless of the input. This could be used for testing or as a placeholder.\n- **`pAuthMint`**: A minting policy that checks if a specific multisig certificate is present in the transaction inputs. If the certificate is found, the minting is authorized; otherwise, it fails.\n\nThis code demonstrates basic patterns in Plutarch for writing validator and minting policy scripts, including handling transaction contexts and using utility functions to check conditions.", "file_path": "iscovery/src/AlwaysFails.hs", "file": "AlwaysFails.hs"}

The specific task of this code is to ensure that any usage of wrapped built-in functions from the UPLC (Untyped Plutus Core) is correctly imported and used. Let's break down the code in detail:\n\n### Key Components\n\n1. **Imports and Constants:**\n   - The code imports several modules and classes, such as `re`, `copy`, and `Enum`, which are used for regular expressions, copying objects, and defining enumerations, respectively.\n   - `CompilingNodeTransformer` and `TypedFunctionDef` are imported from the local module, which are likely custom classes for handling AST transformations and typed function definitions.\n   - `DECORATOR_NAME` is a constant set to `\"wraps_builtin\"`, which is the name of the decorator expected to be used for wrapping built-in functions.\n\n2. **Class `RewriteImportUPLCBuiltins`:**\n   - This class inherits from `CompilingNodeTransformer`, indicating it is designed to transform nodes in an AST during the compilation process.\n   - The class has a class-level attribute `step` that describes its role in the compilation process: \"Resolving imports and usage of UPLC builtins\".\n   - `imports_uplc_builtins` is a boolean attribute initialized to `False`, used to track whether the necessary import statement has been encountered.\n\n3. **Method `visit_ImportFrom`:**\n   - This method processes `ImportFrom` nodes in the AST, which represent import statements like `from module import name`.\n   - It checks if the module being imported from is `\"opshin.bridge\"`. If not, it returns the node unchanged.\n   - For each name being imported, it asserts that the name is exactly `DECORATOR_NAME` and that it is not being renamed (i.e., `asname` is `None`).\n   - If these conditions are met, it sets `imports_uplc_builtins` to `True`, indicating that the necessary import has been found.\n\n4. **Method `visit_FunctionDef`:**\n   - This method processes `FunctionDef` nodes, which represent function definitions in the AST.\n   - It checks if the function has exactly one decorator. If not, it returns the node unchanged.\n   - It verifies if the decorator is a name and matches the expected decorator (`wraps_builtin`).\n   - If the function is wrapped, it asserts that `imports_uplc_builtins` is `True`. If not, it raises an assertion error, instructing the user to add the necessary import statement.\n   - If the function is correctly wrapped and imported, it transforms the function body to forward the call to the corresponding UPLC built-in function:\n     - It constructs a CamelCase version of the original function name.\n     - It retrieves the corresponding UPLC function from a dictionary (`plt.__dict__`).\n     - It creates a `RawPlutoExpr` object representing the call to the UPLC function, with the function's arguments being forced (evaluated immediately).\n     - It copies the original function node and replaces its body with a `Return` statement that returns the `RawPlutoExpr`.\n\n### Summary\n\nThis code is part of a compilation process that ensures the correct usage of UPLC built-in functions in a smart contract. It checks for the necessary import of a decorator (`wraps_builtin`) and transforms functions that use this decorator to call the corresponding UPLC built-in functions directly. This transformation is crucial for ensuring that the smart contract correctly interfaces with the low-level UPLC functions provided by the Cardano blockchain.", "file_path": "opshin/opshin/rewrite/rewrite_import_uplc_builtins.py", "file": "rewrite_import_uplc_builtins.py"}

Modules in Haskell are used to group related functions, types, and typeclasses together.\n\n### Imports\n\n```haskell\nimport Plutarch.Builtin (pconstrBuiltin, pforgetData)\nimport Plutarch.Prelude\nimport Plutarch.Unsafe (punsafeCoerce)\n```\n\n- `Plutarch.Builtin`: This module provides built-in functions for working with Plutarch's low-level data types. `pconstrBuiltin` is used to construct Plutarch data types, and `pforgetData` is used to convert `PAsData` types to their underlying representation.\n- `Plutarch.Prelude`: This module includes essential Plutarch functions and types.\n- `Plutarch.Unsafe`: This module provides unsafe operations, such as `punsafeCoerce`, which allows for type coercion without type checking.\n\n### Type Definition\n\n```haskell\ntype PTuple3 a b c =\n    PDataSum\n        '[ '[ \"_0\" ':= a\n            , \"_1\" ':= b\n            , \"_2\" ':= c\n            ]\n         ]\n```\n\n- `PTuple3 a b c`: This is a type alias for a Plutarch data type that represents a tuple with three elements. It uses `PDataSum`, which is a sum type (similar to a union type) that can hold different types of data.\n- The list `'[ '_0 ':= a, '_1 ':= b, '_2 ':= c ]` defines a single constructor with three fields, each associated with a type (`a`, `b`, and `c`).\n\n### Function Definition\n\n```haskell\nptuple3 :: Term s (PAsData a :--> PAsData b :--> PAsData c :--> PTuple3 a b c)\n```\n\n- `ptuple3`: This is a function that constructs a `PTuple3` from three `PAsData` values. `PAsData` is a wrapper type used in Plutarch to represent data that can be serialized on the blockchain.\n- The type signature indicates that `ptuple3` takes three arguments of types `PAsData a`, `PAsData b`, and `PAsData c`, and returns a `PTuple3 a b c`.\n\n```haskell\nptuple3 = phoistAcyclic $\n    plam $ \\x y z ->\n        let target :: Term _ (PAsData (PBuiltinPair PInteger (PBuiltinList PData)))\n            target = pconstrBuiltin # 0 #$ pcons # pforgetData x #$ pcons # pforgetData y #$ pcons # pforgetData z # pnil\n         in punsafeCoerce target\n```\n\n- `phoistAcyclic`: This is a Plutarch function that optimizes the function by hoisting it out of recursive contexts, ensuring it is evaluated only once.\n- `plam`: This is a Plutarch function that creates a lambda abstraction, allowing you to define a function with parameters `x`, `y`, and `z`.\n- `target`: This is a local variable that constructs a Plutarch data structure using `pconstrBuiltin`. It creates a built-in pair with an integer and a list of `PData`.\n  - `pconstrBuiltin # 0`: Constructs a data type with constructor index `0`.\n  - `pcons`: Constructs a list by prepending an element.\n  - `pforgetData`: Converts `PAsData` to its underlying `PData` representation.\n  - `pnil`: Represents an empty list.\n- `punsafeCoerce target`: This coerces the constructed data type to the desired `PTuple3 a b c` type. This is unsafe because it bypasses type checking, so it should be used with caution.\n\n### Summary\n\nThis code defines a type and a function to create a tuple with three elements in Plutarch.

The code focuses on handling imports from Python's `hashlib` module, specifically for cryptographic hash functions. Let's break down the code in detail:\n\n### Imports and Dependencies\n\n- **Typing and Enum**: The code uses Python's `typing` module for type annotations and `Enum` for defining a set of named constants.\n- **Dataclass**: The `dataclass` decorator is used to create immutable and hashable class types.\n- **Custom Modules**: The code imports `CompilingNodeTransformer` from a utility module and various types from a `typed_ast` module, which likely provides an abstract syntax tree (AST) representation with type information.\n\n### HashType Class\n\n- **Purpose**: `HashType` is a pseudo-class representing the result of Python hash functions that require a `digest` call.\n- **Attributes**: It defines an `attribute_type` method that specifies the type of the `digest` attribute, which is a function returning a `ByteStringInstanceType`.\n- **Methods**: The `attribute` method returns a lambda function for the `digest` attribute, and the `__ge__` method checks if another object is an instance of `HashType`.\n\n### Hash Instance Type\n\n- **HashInstanceType**: This is an instance of `HashType`, representing a specific type of hash object.\n\n### PythonHashlib Enum\n\n- **Purpose**: Defines constants for supported hash functions: `sha256`, `sha3_256`, and `blake2b`.\n\n### PythonHashlibTypes Dictionary\n\n- **Purpose**: Maps each hash function in `PythonHashlib` to its corresponding type. Each type is a function that takes a `ByteStringInstanceType` and returns a `HashInstanceType`.\n\n### PythonHashlibImpls Dictionary\n\n- **Purpose**: Maps each hash function to its implementation using lambda expressions. These implementations use placeholder functions (`plt.Sha2_256`, `plt.Sha3_256`, `plt.Blake2b_256`) to represent the actual hash computations.\n\n### RewriteImportHashlib Class\n\n- **Purpose**: A transformer class that processes Python AST nodes to handle imports from the `hashlib` module.\n- **Attributes**: \n  - `step`: Describes the transformation step.\n  - `imports_hashlib`: A flag indicating whether `hashlib` has been imported.\n- **Methods**:\n  - `visit_ImportFrom`: This method processes `ImportFrom` nodes in the AST. If the module being imported is `hashlib`, it checks each imported name against the `PythonHashlib` enum. If a match is found, it creates a `TypedAssign` node that assigns the appropriate type and implementation to the imported name. This effectively rewrites the import to use the custom hash function implementations defined earlier.\n\n### Summary\n\nThis code is part of a system that transforms Python code to be compatible with a specific execution environment, likely for smart contracts on Cardano. It specifically handles imports from the `hashlib` module, providing custom implementations for certain hash functions (`sha256`, `sha3_256`, `blake2b`). The transformation ensures that these functions are correctly typed and implemented in the target environment, allowing for secure and efficient cryptographic operations.", "file_path": "opshin/opshin/rewrite/rewrite_import_hashlib.py", "file": "rewrite_import_hashlib.py"}

Let's break down the code in detail:\n\n### Module and Imports\n\n```haskell\nmodule Test.Plutip.Tools.DebugCli (\n  debugCli,\n  utxoAtAddress,\n) where\n```\n\n- **Module Declaration**: The module is named `Test.Plutip.Tools.DebugCli` and it exports two functions: `debugCli` and `utxoAtAddress`.\n\n```haskell\nimport Cardano.Launcher.Node (nodeSocketFile)\nimport Data.ByteString.Lazy.Char8 qualified as BS\nimport GHC.IO.Exception (ExitCode (ExitSuccess))\nimport System.Environment (getEnvironment)\nimport System.Exit (ExitCode (ExitFailure))\nimport System.Process.Typed (\n  proc,\n  readProcess,\n  setEnv,\n )\nimport Test.Plutip.Internal.Types (ClusterEnv, nodeSocket)\n```\n\n- **Imports**:\n  - `Cardano.Launcher.Node`: Provides functionality to get the node socket file path.\n  - `Data.ByteString.Lazy.Char8`: Used for handling lazy byte strings, which are suitable for I/O operations.\n  - `GHC.IO.Exception` and `System.Exit`: Used for handling process exit codes.\n  - `System.Environment`: Used to get the current environment variables.\n  - `System.Process.Typed`: Provides functions to create and manage system processes.\n  - `Test.Plutip.Internal.Types`: Imports `ClusterEnv`, which likely contains environment configuration for a Cardano cluster.\n\n### `debugCli` Function\n\n```haskell\ndebugCli ::\n  ClusterEnv ->\n  [String] ->\n  IO BS.ByteString\ndebugCli cEnv args = do\n  env <- getEnvironment\n  let socket = nodeSocketFile $ nodeSocket cEnv\n      process =\n        setEnv ((\"CARDANO_NODE_SOCKET_PATH\", socket) : env) $\n          proc \"cardano-cli\" args\n  (st, out, err) <- readProcess process\n  pure $ case st of\n    ExitSuccess -> out\n    ExitFailure _ -> err\n```\n\n- **Purpose**: This function executes the `cardano-cli` command with the provided arguments and returns the output as a lazy `ByteString`.\n- **Parameters**:\n  - `cEnv`: A `ClusterEnv` object that contains the environment configuration for the Cardano node.\n  - `args`: A list of strings representing the arguments to pass to `cardano-cli`.\n- **Process**:\n  1. **Get Environment**: Retrieves the current environment variables.\n  2. **Socket Path**: Extracts the node socket file path from the `ClusterEnv`.\n  3. **Process Setup**: Configures the process to run `cardano-cli` with the specified arguments and sets the `CARDANO_NODE_SOCKET_PATH` environment variable.\n  4. **Execute Process**: Runs the process and captures the exit status, standard output, and standard error.\n  5. **Return Output**: Returns the standard output if the process succeeds, otherwise returns the error output.\n\n### `utxoAtAddress` Function\n\n```haskell\nutxoAtAddress :: ClusterEnv -> String -> IO ()\nutxoAtAddress ce addr = do\n  res <- debugCli ce [\"query\", \"utxo\", \"--mainnet\", \"--address\", addr]\n  BS.putStrLn $ \"UTxO at \" <> BS.pack addr <> \": \" <> res\n```\n\n- **Purpose**: Queries the UTxOs at a specified address on the Cardano mainnet and prints the result.\n- **Parameters**:\n  - `ce`: A `ClusterEnv` object for the Cardano node environment.\n  - `addr`: A string representing the Cardano address to query.\n- **Process**:\n  1. **Call `debugCli`**: Uses `debugCli` to execute the `cardano-cli query utxo` command with the `--mainnet` flag and the specified address.\n  2. **Print Result**: Outputs the UTxO information to the console, prefixed with the address.\n\n### Summary\n\nThis module provides a simple interface to interact with the Cardano blockchain using `cardano-cli`. It abstracts the process of setting up the environment and executing commands, making it easier to query blockchain data, such as UTxOs at a specific address. The use of `ClusterEnv` suggests that this code is intended to be used in a testing or development environment where a Cardano node is running.", "file_path": "plutip/src/Test/Plutip/Tools/DebugCli.hs", "file": "DebugCli.hs"}

The tests within this group are specified in the list that follows.\n\n- **`[ Integration.test, BotInterface.test ]`**: This is a list of tests to be run. `Integration.test` and `BotInterface.test` are presumably test suites or individual tests defined in their respective modules. \n\n### Comment\n\n```haskell\n-- FIXME: both `Integration.test` and `BotInterface.test`\n-- start own cluster to run tests, probably, need better solution in future\n```\n\nThis comment indicates a known issue or limitation in the current setup. Both `Integration.test` and `BotInterface.test` start their own Cardano cluster to run tests. This might be inefficient or problematic, and the comment suggests that a better solution is needed in the future. This could involve sharing a single cluster instance between tests to save resources and time.\n\n### Summary\n\nThis code sets up a test suite for Cardano smart contracts using the Plutus framework.

Let's break down the code step by step:\n\n### Function Definition\n\n```python\ndef validator(n: int) -> int:\n```\n\n- The function `validator` takes a single integer argument `n` and returns an integer. This function is likely intended to be used as a validator script in a Cardano smart contract.\n\n### Tuple Assignment\n\n```python\na, b = 3, n\n```\n\n- This line demonstrates tuple unpacking in Python. It assigns the value `3` to `a` and the value of the input parameter `n` to `b`.\n\n### Control Flow: If Statement\n\n```python\nif b < 5:\n    print(\"add\")\n    a += 5\n```\n\n- If `b` (which is initially `n`) is less than 5, the code prints \"add\" and increments `a` by 5.\n\n### Control Flow: While Loop\n\n```python\nwhile b < 5:\n    b += 1\n```\n\n- This loop increments `b` until it is no longer less than 5. If `b` starts at 5 or more, this loop does nothing.\n\n### Control Flow: For Loop\n\n```python\nfor i in range(2):\n    print(\"loop\", i)\n```\n\n- This loop iterates twice (for `i` values 0 and 1) and prints \"loop\" followed by the current value of `i`.\n\n### Hashing\n\n```python\nfrom hashlib import sha256 as hsh\nx = hsh(b\"123\").digest()\n```\n\n- The code imports the `sha256` hashing function from Python's `hashlib` module and aliases it as `hsh`.\n- It then computes the SHA-256 hash of the byte string `b\"123\"` and stores the resulting hash (a bytes object) in `x`.\n\n### Bytestring Slicing and Assertions\n\n```python\nassert x[1:3] == b\"e\" + b\"\\xa4\", \"Hash is wrong\"\n```\n\n- This line checks that the second and third bytes of the hash `x` are equal to the bytes `b\"e\\xa4\"`.\n- If this condition is not met, the assertion will fail, and the message \"Hash is wrong\" will be raised as an error.\n\n### List Operations and Conditional Return\n\n```python\ny = [1, 2]\nreturn a + len(x) + len(y) if y[0] == 1 else 0\n```\n\n- A list `y` is created with elements `[1, 2]`.\n- The function returns the sum of `a`, the length of `x` (which is the length of the SHA-256 hash, typically 32 bytes), and the length of `y` (which is 2) if the first element of `y` is `1`.\n- If `y[0]` is not `1`, the function returns `0`.\n\n### Summary\n\nThis smart contract function demonstrates various Python features such as tuple unpacking, control flow with `if`, `while`, and `for` loops, hashing with SHA-256, bytestring slicing, assertions, and list operations. The function's behavior is determined by the input `n` and the hardcoded values and conditions within the function. The function's primary purpose seems to be educational, showcasing different language features rather than implementing a specific business logic.", "file_path": "opshin/examples/showcase.py", "file": "showcase.py"}

The code provides utility functions for handling various operations related to staking credentials, asset configuration comparison, and beacon script execution. Let's break down each part of the code:\n\n### Imports\n\nThe code begins with a series of `use` statements, which import various modules and types from the Aiken standard library and a custom library (`cardano_swaps`). These imports provide necessary functions and types for handling byte arrays, dictionaries, hashes, lists, transaction credentials, and values.\n\n### Utility Functions\n\n1. **`trace_if_false` Function:**\n   - **Purpose:** Logs a message if a given predicate (boolean condition) is false.\n   - **Parameters:**\n     - `msg`: A string message to log.\n     - `predicate`: A boolean condition.\n   - **Behavior:** If the predicate is false, it logs the message using `trace` and returns the predicate. If true, it simply returns the predicate.\n\n2. **`error_if_false` Function:**\n   - **Purpose:** Throws an error with a message if a given predicate is false.\n   - **Parameters:**\n     - `msg`: A string message for the error.\n     - `predicate`: A boolean condition.\n   - **Behavior:** If the predicate is false, it throws an error with the message. If true, it returns the predicate.\n\n### Staking Credential Approval\n\n3. **`staking_credential_approves` Function:**\n   - **Purpose:** Checks if the staking credential associated with a swap address has approved a transaction.\n   - **Parameters:**\n     - `swap_addr`: The address involved in the swap.\n     - `withdrawals`: A dictionary mapping staking credentials to withdrawal amounts.\n     - `extra_signatories`: A list of hashes representing additional signatories.\n   - **Behavior:** \n     - If the address has no staking credential, it returns `True`.\n     - If the address uses a staking public key, it checks if the key is in the list of extra signatories.\n     - If the address uses a staking script, it checks if the script's credential is in the withdrawals dictionary.\n\n### Asset Configuration Comparison\n\n4. **`compare_asset_config` Function:**\n   - **Purpose:** Compares two asset configurations.\n   - **Parameters:**\n     - `asset1`, `asset2`: Two `AssetConfig` objects to compare.\n   - **Behavior:** \n     - Compares the policy IDs of the two assets.\n     - If the policy IDs are equal, it compares the asset names.\n     - Returns an `Ordering` (`Less`, `Greater`, or `Equal`) based on the comparison.\n\n### Beacon Script Execution\n\n5. **`has_beacon_script_minting_execution` Function:**\n   - **Purpose:** Checks if a beacon script was executed during minting.\n   - **Parameters:**\n     - `beacon_id`: The policy ID of the beacon.\n     - `mint`: The minted value in the transaction.\n   - **Behavior:** \n     - Converts the minted value to a token list and checks if there are any tokens associated with the beacon ID.\n     - Returns `True` if there are tokens, indicating the script was executed.\n\n6. **`has_beacon_script_staking_execution` Function:**\n   - **Purpose:** Checks if a beacon script was executed during staking.\n   - **Parameters:**\n     - `beacon_id`: The policy ID of the beacon.\n     - `withdrawals`: A dictionary of staking credentials and withdrawal amounts.\n   - **Behavior:** \n     - Checks if the beacon script's credential is a key in the withdrawals dictionary.\n     - Returns `True` if the script's credential is present, indicating execution.\n\n### Summary\n\nThis code provides utility functions for handling staking credentials, comparing asset configurations, and verifying the execution of beacon scripts in the context of Cardano swaps. These functions are essential for ensuring that transactions meet specific conditions and that assets are correctly managed within the smart contract.", "file_path": "no-swaps/aiken/lib/cardano_swaps/common/utils.ak", "file": "utils.ak"}

Let's break down the code in detail:\n\n### Imports and Dependencies\n\n- **Standard Library Imports:**\n  - `ast`: Provides classes and functions to interact with Python's Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).\n  - `importlib`, `importlib.util`: Used for importing modules programmatically.\n  - `pathlib`: Provides an object-oriented interface to handle filesystem paths.\n  - `typing`: Provides type hints.\n  - `sys`: Provides access to system-specific parameters and functions.\n\n- **Third-Party Imports:**\n  - `ordered_set`: Provides an ordered set data structure, which maintains the order of elements.\n\n- **Local Imports:**\n  - `CompilingNodeTransformer`: A custom class likely used for transforming AST nodes during compilation.\n\n### Function: `import_module`\n\nThis function is a custom implementation of Python's import mechanism. It attempts to import a module by its name, handling both top-level and submodules. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Resolve the Module Name:** Uses `importlib.util.resolve_name` to get the absolute name of the module.\n2. **Check if Already Imported:** Looks in `sys.modules` to see if the module is already imported.\n3. **Handle Submodules:** If the module name contains a dot, it treats it as a submodule and attempts to import the parent module first.\n4. **Find and Load the Module:** Iterates over `sys.meta_path` to find a loader for the module and then loads it.\n5. **Cache the Module:** Once loaded, the module is stored in `sys.modules` to avoid re-importing.\n6. **Set as Attribute:** If it's a submodule, it sets the module as an attribute of the parent module.\n\n### Class: `RewriteLocation`\n\nThis class is a subclass of `CompilingNodeTransformer` and is used to copy the location (line numbers, etc.) from an original AST node to a new node. This is useful for maintaining accurate debugging and error reporting information after transformations.\n\n- **`__init__`:** Initializes with the original node.\n- **`visit`:** Copies the location from the original node to the current node and then visits the node using the superclass method.\n\n### Class: `RewriteImport`\n\nThis class is responsible for resolving imports in the AST. It is also a subclass of `CompilingNodeTransformer`.\n\n- **Attributes:**\n  - `step`: A string indicating the current step, \"Resolving imports\".\n  - `filename`: The name of the file being processed.\n  - `package`: The package context for relative imports.\n  - `resolved_imports`: An `OrderedSet` to keep track of already resolved imports to avoid duplication.\n\n- **`visit_ImportFrom`:** This method handles `from ... import ...` statements in the AST.\n  - **Allowed Modules:** If the module is one of a predefined set (e.g., `pycardano`, `typing`), it returns the node as is.\n  - **Assertions:** Ensures that the import statement is of the form `from <pkg> import *`.\n  - **Path Management:** Temporarily adds the directory of the current file to `sys.path` to resolve imports.\n  - **Module Resolution:** Uses `import_module` to import the module.\n  - **File Handling:** Ensures the module file is a Python file (`.py`) and not a compiled file (`.pyc`).\n  - **Recursive Resolution:** Reads the module file, parses it into an AST, and recursively resolves imports within it.\n  - **Return:** Returns the body of the resolved module, effectively inlining the imported module's content.\n\n### Summary\n\nThis script is part of a system that processes Python code, likely for compiling or transforming it into a form suitable for Cardano smart contracts. It focuses on resolving imports, particularly those of the form `from <pkg> import *`, by inlining the imported module's content into the current module. This approach ensures that all necessary code is available in a single context, which can be crucial for environments where dynamic imports are not feasible or desired.", "file_path": "opshin/opshin/rewrite/rewrite_import.py", "file": "rewrite_import.py"}

The purpose of this transformation is to clean up certain types of assignments that are only relevant during type inference and are not needed in the final compiled code.

They represent different components and types used in the type inference process.\n- **CompilingNodeTransformer**: A utility class from the `util` module that likely provides a framework for transforming nodes in an AST.\n\n### Class: `RewriteRemoveTypeStuff`\n\nThis class inherits from `CompilingNodeTransformer`, suggesting it is designed to traverse and transform nodes in an AST.\n\n- **step**: A class attribute that describes the transformation step being performed. Here, it indicates that the transformation involves removing certain class and polymorphic function re-assignments.\n\n#### Method: `visit_Assign`\n\nThis method is designed to process assignment nodes (`TypedAssign`) in the AST. It attempts to remove certain types of assignments that are not needed after type inference.\n\n1. **Assertion**: \n   - The method asserts that each assignment node has exactly one target. This means the transformation does not support assignments to multiple variables at once (e.g., `a, b = 1, 2`).\n\n2. **Type Checking**:\n   - The method checks if the type of the value being assigned is a `ClassType`.\n   - If it is a `ClassType`, it attempts to retrieve its constructor type using `constr_type()`.\n   - If `constr_type()` raises a `TypeInferenceError`, the method returns `None`, effectively removing this assignment from the AST. This suggests that assignments to class types without a constructor are not needed.\n\n3. **Polymorphic Function Type Check**:\n   - If the type is not a `ClassType`, it checks if it is an `InstanceType` and if its type is a `PolymorphicFunctionType`.\n   - If both conditions are true, the method returns `None`, removing the assignment. This indicates that re-assignments involving polymorphic functions are also discarded.\n\n4. **AttributeError Handling**:\n   - If an `AttributeError` occurs (likely because the node's value does not have a `typ` attribute), the method allows it to pass, implying that untyped attributes are acceptable and do not need to be removed.\n\n5. **Return**:\n   - If none of the conditions for removal are met, the method returns the original node, leaving the assignment unchanged.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe `RewriteRemoveTypeStuff` class is a transformation utility that cleans up the AST by removing unnecessary assignments related to class types without constructors and polymorphic function types. These assignments are only relevant during type inference and are not needed in the final compiled code. This process helps streamline the AST, making it more efficient for subsequent compilation steps.", "file_path": "opshin/opshin/rewrite/rewrite_remove_type_stuff.py", "file": "rewrite_remove_type_stuff.py"}

The code is specifically dealing with fractions, which are a part of mathematical operations that can be useful in various financial and computational contexts within smart contracts.\n\nLet's break down the code:\n\n1. **Import Statement**:\n   ```python\n   from opshin.std.fractions import *\n   ```\n   This line imports everything from the `fractions` module within the `opshin.std` package. The `fractions` module likely provides utilities for working with fractional numbers, similar to Python's standard `fractions` module, but tailored for use in the Opshin environment.\n\n2. **Function Definition**:\n   ```python\n   def mul_fraction_int(a: Fraction, b: int) -> Fraction:\n   ```\n   This line defines a function named `mul_fraction_int` that takes two parameters:\n   - `a`: A `Fraction` object, which represents a rational number with a numerator and a denominator.\n   - `b`: An integer (`int`), which is a whole number.\n\n   The function is annotated to return a `Fraction` object.\n\n3. **Docstring**:\n   ```python\n   \"\"\"returns a * b\"\"\"\n   ```\n   This is a docstring, which is a string literal used to document the purpose of the function. It indicates that the function returns the product of the fraction `a` and the integer `b`.\n\n4. **Function Implementation**:\n   ```python\n   return Fraction(a.numerator * b, a.denominator)\n   ```\n   This line performs the actual computation. It creates and returns a new `Fraction` object. The numerator of this new fraction is the product of the numerator of `a` and the integer `b`. The denominator remains the same as that of `a`.\n\n   - `a.numerator * b`: This multiplies the numerator of the fraction `a` by the integer `b`.\n   - `a.denominator`: This keeps the denominator unchanged.\n\n   The result is a new fraction that represents the product of the original fraction `a` and the integer `b`.\n\n**Purpose and Use Case**:\n- This function is useful in scenarios where you need to scale a fraction by an integer. For example, in financial applications, you might need to multiply a fractional interest rate by a number of periods or units.\n- By keeping the denominator the same, the function ensures that the result is still a valid fraction, maintaining the precision of fractional arithmetic.\n\nOverall, this code snippet is a utility function that simplifies the multiplication of a fraction by an integer, which can be a common operation in smart contracts dealing with fractional values.", "file_path": "uada-contracts/uada/onchain/utils/ext_fraction.py", "file": "ext_fraction.py"}

Let's break down the code in detail:\n\n### Module and Imports\n\n```haskell\nmodule ErgoDex.PValidators (\n    poolValidator,\n    swapValidator,\n    depositValidator,\n    redeemValidator,\n    validatorAddress,\n    wrapValidator,\n) where\n```\n\n- **Module Declaration**: The module `ErgoDex.PValidators` is declared, and it exports several functions: `poolValidator`, `swapValidator`, `depositValidator`, `redeemValidator`, `validatorAddress`, and `wrapValidator`.\n\n```haskell\nimport PlutusLedgerApi.V1.Scripts (Validator (getValidator))\nimport PlutusLedgerApi.V1.Address\n```\n\n- **Imports**: The code imports necessary modules from the Plutus Ledger API, which provides types and functions for working with scripts and addresses.\n\n```haskell\nimport qualified ErgoDex.PContracts.PDeposit as PD\nimport qualified ErgoDex.PContracts.PPool as PP\nimport qualified ErgoDex.PContracts.PRedeem as PR\nimport qualified ErgoDex.PContracts.PSwap as PS\n```\n\n- **Qualified Imports**: These imports bring in specific contract logic for deposit, pool, redeem, and swap operations from the `ErgoDex.PContracts` namespace, each aliased for easy reference.\n\n```haskell\nimport Plutarch\nimport Plutarch.Api.V2 (mkValidator, validatorHash)\nimport Plutarch.Api.V2.Contexts (PScriptContext)\nimport Plutarch.Prelude\nimport Plutarch.Unsafe (punsafeCoerce)\n```\n\n- **Plutarch Imports**: These imports bring in core Plutarch functionality, including the ability to create validators, work with script contexts, and perform unsafe operations like coercing data types.\n\n### Core Functionality\n\n#### `wrapValidator`\n\n```haskell\nwrapValidator ::\n    (PIsData dt, PIsData rdmr) =>\n    Term s (dt :--> rdmr :--> PScriptContext :--> PBool) ->\n    Term s (PData :--> PData :--> PScriptContext :--> POpaque)\nwrapValidator validator = plam $ \\datum redeemer ctx ->\n    let dt = pfromData $ punsafeCoerce datum\n        rdmr = pfromData $ punsafeCoerce redeemer\n        result = validator # dt # rdmr # ctx\n     in popaque $ pif result (pcon PUnit) (ptraceError \"Validator reduced to False\")\n```\n\n- **Type Signature**: The `wrapValidator` function takes a validator function that operates on specific data types (`dt` and `rdmr`) and returns a wrapped version that operates on generic `PData` types.\n- **Function Logic**:\n  - `plam`: Defines a Plutarch lambda function.\n  - `punsafeCoerce`: Unsafely coerces `PData` to the expected data types (`dt` and `rdmr`).\n  - `validator # dt # rdmr # ctx`: Applies the validator to the coerced datum, redeemer, and context.\n  - `popaque`: Wraps the result in an opaque type, returning `PUnit` if true, or tracing an error if false.\n\n#### Validators\n\n```haskell\npoolValidator :: Validator\npoolValidator = mkValidator $ wrapValidator PP.poolValidatorT\n\nswapValidator :: Validator\nswapValidator = mkValidator $ wrapValidator PS.swapValidatorT\n\ndepositValidator :: Validator\ndepositValidator = mkValidator $ wrapValidator PD.depositValidatorT\n\nredeemValidator :: Validator\nredeemValidator = mkValidator $ wrapValidator PR.redeemValidatorT\n```\n\n- **Validator Definitions**: Each validator is created using `mkValidator`, which takes a wrapped validator function specific to each contract type (pool, swap, deposit, redeem). These functions (`PP.poolValidatorT`, `PS.swapValidatorT`, etc.) are assumed to be defined in their respective modules.\n\n#### `validatorAddress`\n\n```haskell\nvalidatorAddress :: Validator -> Address\nvalidatorAddress = scriptHashAddress . validatorHash\n```\n\n- **Functionality**: This function takes a `Validator` and computes its blockchain address by first obtaining the validator's hash (`validatorHash`) and then converting it to an address (`scriptHashAddress`).\n\n### Summary\n\nThis module provides a structured way to define and wrap validators for different operations in a DEX on Cardano. The `wrapValidator` function is a key utility that ensures validators can be applied to generic data types, making them compatible with the Plutus infrastructure. Each specific validator (pool, swap, deposit, redeem) is defined by wrapping its corresponding logic from the imported modules. The `validatorAddress` function allows for easy retrieval of a validator's address on the blockchain.", "file_path": "no-dex-contracts/cardano-dex-contracts-onchain/ErgoDex/PContracts/PValidators.hs", "file": "PValidators.hs"}

In Haskell, the `Main` module is special because it is the entry point of the program. When you compile and run a Haskell program, the `main` function within the `Main` module is executed.\n\n### Imports\n\n```haskell\nimport Options.Applicative\nimport CLI.Parsers (parseCommand)\nimport CLI.Run\n```\n\n- `Options.Applicative`: This is a Haskell library used for parsing command-line options. It provides utilities to define and process command-line arguments in a structured way.\n- `CLI.Parsers (parseCommand)`: This imports the `parseCommand` function from the `CLI.Parsers` module. This function is likely responsible for defining how command-line arguments are parsed.\n- `CLI.Run`: This module is imported entirely, suggesting it contains functions or definitions needed to execute the parsed commands.\n\n### Main Function\n\n```haskell\nmain :: IO ()\nmain = do\n  let preferences = prefs $ showHelpOnError <> showHelpOnEmpty\n      opts = info (parseCommand <**> helper) (fullDesc <> progDesc \"A fully p2p Cardano DEX\")\n  customExecParser preferences opts >>= runCommand\n```\n\n- `main :: IO ()`: This type signature indicates that `main` is an I/O action that returns no meaningful value (i.e., `()` is the unit type).\n\n- `do` block: This is a syntactic construct in Haskell that allows sequencing of I/O actions.\n\n- `preferences`: This is a local variable that sets preferences for the command-line parser. It uses `prefs` to configure:\n  - `showHelpOnError`: Automatically shows help text if there's an error in parsing the command-line arguments.\n  - `showHelpOnEmpty`: Shows help text if no arguments are provided.\n\n- `opts`: This variable defines the command-line options parser. It uses `info` to combine:\n  - `parseCommand <**> helper`: This expression combines the `parseCommand` parser with a helper function that automatically adds a `--help` option to the command-line interface.\n  - `fullDesc <> progDesc \"A fully p2p Cardano DEX\"`: This provides a full description of the program and a short program description. The description \"A fully p2p Cardano DEX\" is likely displayed when the user requests help.\n\n- `customExecParser preferences opts`: This function runs the command-line parser with the specified preferences and options. It returns the parsed command.\n\n- `>>= runCommand`: This is the bind operator (`>>=`) in Haskell, used for chaining monadic operations. It takes the result of `customExecParser` and passes it to `runCommand`, which is presumably a function that executes the parsed command.\n\n### Summary\n\nThis code sets up a command-line interface for a Cardano DEX application. It uses the `Options.Applicative` library to define and parse command-line arguments, providing helpful error messages and usage information. The parsed command is then executed by the `runCommand` function, which is likely defined in the `CLI.Run` module. The application is described as a \"fully p2p Cardano DEX,\" indicating its purpose as a decentralized exchange on the Cardano blockchain.", "file_path": "no-swaps/app/Main.hs", "file": "Main.hs"}

This object represents an empty list in UPLC. The `typ` attribute of the node is preserved, and the `expr` is set to the result of `empty_list(node.typ.typ.typ)`, which is presumably a function that generates the UPLC representation of an empty list for the given type.\n\n#### Method: `visit_Constant`\n\n- **Parameters**:\n  - `node`: An instance of `TypedConstant`, representing a constant node in the AST.\n\n- **Functionality**:\n  - The method checks if the constant value (`node.value`) is an empty list.\n  - If the value is not an empty list, it returns the node unchanged.\n  - If the value is an empty list, it returns a `RawPlutoExpr` object, similar to the `visit_List` method, to represent the empty list in UPLC.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe `RewriteEmptyLists` class is a transformation utility that optimizes the representation of empty lists in the AST of a smart contract. By converting these empty lists into UPLC constants, the transformation ensures that the compiled smart contract code is more efficient and better suited for execution on the Cardano blockchain.

The code defines a simple recursive function to calculate Fibonacci numbers and a validator function that uses this Fibonacci function. Let's break down the code:\n\n### Fibonacci Function\n\n```python\ndef fib(n: int) -> int:\n    if n == 0:\n        res = 0\n    elif n == 1:\n        res = 1\n    else:\n        res = fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)\n    return res\n```\n\n- **Function Definition**: The function `fib` takes an integer `n` as input and returns an integer. This function is designed to compute the nth Fibonacci number.\n  \n- **Base Cases**:\n  - If `n` is 0, the function returns 0. This is the first base case of the Fibonacci sequence.\n  - If `n` is 1, the function returns 1. This is the second base case of the Fibonacci sequence.\n\n- **Recursive Case**:\n  - For any other value of `n` (i.e., `n > 1`), the function calls itself recursively to compute the sum of the two preceding Fibonacci numbers: `fib(n - 1)` and `fib(n - 2)`.\n  - This recursive approach follows the mathematical definition of Fibonacci numbers: `F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)` for `n > 1`.\n\n- **Return Statement**: The result of the computation is stored in the variable `res`, which is then returned.\n\n### Validator Function\n\n```python\ndef validator(n: int) -> int:\n    return fib(n)\n```\n\n- **Function Definition**: The `validator` function also takes an integer `n` as input and returns an integer.\n  \n- **Functionality**: This function simply calls the `fib` function with the input `n` and returns the result. Essentially, it acts as a wrapper around the `fib` function.\n\n### Purpose and Usage\n\n- **Purpose**: The primary purpose of this code is to compute Fibonacci numbers. The `validator` function is likely intended to be the entry point for the smart contract, which means it is the function that will be called when the contract is executed on the blockchain.\n\n- **Usage in Smart Contracts**: In the context of a Cardano smart contract, this code could be used to validate transactions or conditions based on Fibonacci numbers. However, due to the recursive nature of the `fib` function, it may not be efficient for large values of `n` because it can lead to a large number of recursive calls and potential stack overflow.\n\n### Considerations\n\n- **Efficiency**: Recursive Fibonacci calculations are not efficient for large `n` due to repeated calculations. An iterative approach or memoization could be used to improve performance.\n\n- **Smart Contract Limitations**: When deploying on a blockchain, computational resources are limited. Recursive functions can be costly in terms of execution time and resources, which is an important consideration for smart contract design.\n\nOverall, this code provides a basic implementation of a Fibonacci sequence calculator within a Cardano smart contract, demonstrating how recursive functions can be used in this context.", "file_path": "opshin/examples/fib_rec.py", "file": "fib_rec.py"}

This is important because AST nodes are mutable, and copying them ensures that the original nodes are not modified directly.\n- `ast`: This module provides classes and functions to interact with Python's abstract syntax trees. It allows the manipulation of Python code as data.\n- `CompilingNodeTransformer`: This is a custom class (presumably defined elsewhere in the project) that `RewriteConditions` inherits from. It likely provides some base functionality for transforming AST nodes.\n\n### Constants\n\n- `SPECIAL_BOOL = \"~bool\"`: This is a string constant used as a special identifier for the boolean casting function. It is prefixed with a tilde to avoid conflicts with other identifiers.\n\n### Class: `RewriteConditions`\n\nThis class is responsible for transforming the AST to ensure that all conditions are explicitly cast to boolean values.\n\n#### Method: `visit_Module`\n\n- **Purpose**: This method is called when the transformer visits a `Module` node, which represents the entire Python script.\n- **Functionality**: It inserts an assignment at the beginning of the module that assigns the `bool` function to the special identifier `~bool`. This allows the script to use `~bool` as a function to cast values to boolean.\n\n#### Method: `visit_If`\n\n- **Purpose**: This method is called when the transformer visits an `If` node, which represents an `if` statement.\n- **Functionality**: It creates a copy of the `If` node and modifies the `test` attribute (the condition) to be a call to the `~bool` function, ensuring the condition is explicitly cast to a boolean.\n\n#### Method: `visit_IfExp`\n\n- **Purpose**: This method is called when the transformer visits an `IfExp` node, which represents a conditional expression (ternary operator).\n- **Functionality**: Similar to `visit_If`, it casts the condition to a boolean using the `~bool` function.\n\n#### Method: `visit_While`\n\n- **Purpose**: This method is called when the transformer visits a `While` node, which represents a `while` loop.\n- **Functionality**: It ensures the loop condition is explicitly cast to a boolean by wrapping it in a call to `~bool`.\n\n#### Method: `visit_BoolOp`\n\n- **Purpose**: This method is called when the transformer visits a `BoolOp` node, which represents a boolean operation (like `and` or `or`).\n- **Functionality**: It iterates over each value in the boolean operation and casts each one to a boolean using the `~bool` function.\n\n#### Method: `visit_Assert`\n\n- **Purpose**: This method is called when the transformer visits an `Assert` node, which represents an `assert` statement.\n- **Functionality**: It ensures the assertion condition is explicitly cast to a boolean by wrapping it in a call to `~bool`.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe `RewriteConditions` class is designed to traverse a Python AST and modify it so that all conditions are explicitly cast to boolean values using a custom identifier `~bool`.

The `sqlite_db` object is likely an instance of a database connection or ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) manager that handles interactions with the SQLite database.\n\n- **`sqlite_db.create_tables([...])`:** This line creates tables in the database for each of the imported classes. The list passed to `create_tables` includes all the classes that represent different entities and states in the governance system.

The dot (`.`) before the module names (`keys` and `network`) indicates a relative import, meaning these modules are located in the same directory as the `__init__.py` file.\n\n   - **`from .keys import get_address, get_signing_info`:**\n     - `get_address`: This function is likely responsible for generating or retrieving a blockchain address, which is a crucial part of interacting with the Cardano network.\n     - `get_signing_info`: This function probably deals with obtaining signing information, which is necessary for authorizing transactions on the blockchain. This could include retrieving private keys or other cryptographic data needed to sign transactions.\n\n   - **`from .network import ogmios_url, network, kupo_url`:**\n     - `ogmios_url`: This variable likely holds the URL for an Ogmios server. Ogmios is a lightweight bridge interface for Cardano, providing a way to interact with the blockchain using WebSockets.\n     - `network`: This variable might define the network environment being used, such as `mainnet` or `testnet`, which are different environments for deploying and testing blockchain applications.\n     - `kupo_url`: This variable probably contains the URL for a Kupo server. Kupo is a Cardano indexer that provides a way to query blockchain data efficiently.\n\n**Purpose of the `__init__.py` File:**\n\nThe `__init__.py` file in a Python package is used to initialize the package and can be used to define what is available for import when the package is imported. By including these import statements, the `utils` package is making the `get_address`, `get_signing_info`, `ogmios_url`, `network`, and `kupo_url` available to other parts of the project that import the `utils` package. This helps in organizing the code and making it modular, allowing for easier maintenance and reuse of code across the project.\n\nIn summary, this code snippet is setting up the `utils` package to provide essential functions and configuration variables related to blockchain addresses, signing information, and network connectivity, which are crucial for the operation of the MuesliSwap on-chain governance system on the Cardano blockchain.", "file_path": "muesliswap-onchain-governance/muesliswap_onchain_governance/utils/__init__.py", "file": "__init__.py"}

The script is designed to publish a transaction that involves an oracle, which is a service that provides external data to the blockchain. Let's break down the code step by step:\n\n1. **Imports**:\n   - `from util import *`: This imports utility functions and classes that are likely used throughout the script.\n   - `from contract import PublishParams`: This imports the `PublishParams` class, which is used to create a datum for the transaction.\n   - `from time import time`: This imports the `time` function from Python's standard library, which is used to get the current time.\n\n2. **Constants and Variables**:\n   - `INFO = 7`: This is a constant that likely represents some information or identifier related to the oracle data.\n   - `AMOUNT = 12500000`: This is the amount of Lovelace (the smallest unit of ADA, Cardano's cryptocurrency) to be sent in the transaction.\n   - `VALIDITY_TIME = 300`: This represents the validity period for the transaction in seconds (5 minutes).\n   - `owner = oracle_vkey.hash().to_primitive()`: This line computes the hash of the oracle's verification key to get the owner's address in a primitive format.\n   - `deadline = int(time() + VALIDITY_TIME) * 1000`: This calculates the deadline for the transaction by adding the validity time to the current time and converting it to milliseconds.\n   - `amount = Value(AMOUNT)`: This creates a `Value` object representing the amount of Lovelace to be transferred.\n   - `datum = PublishParams(owner, deadline, INFO)`: This creates a datum using the `PublishParams` class, which includes the owner's address, the deadline, and the info constant.\n\n3. **Transaction Building**:\n   - `builder = TransactionBuilder(context)`: This initializes a `TransactionBuilder` object with the current blockchain context. This object is used to construct the transaction.\n   - `builder.add_input_address(oracle_address)`: This adds an input to the transaction from the oracle's address, indicating that the funds will be drawn from this address.\n   - `builder.add_output(TransactionOutput(script_address, amount=amount, datum=datum))`: This adds an output to the transaction, specifying the destination script address, the amount to be sent, and the datum to be included.\n\n4. **Signing and Submitting the Transaction**:\n   - `signed_tx = builder.build_and_sign([oracle_skey], change_address=oracle_address)`: This builds and signs the transaction using the oracle's signing key (`oracle_skey`). The change from the transaction, if any, will be sent back to the oracle's address.\n   - `save_transaction(signed_tx, \"transactions/tx_deposit.signed\")`: This saves the signed transaction to a file named `tx_deposit.signed` in the `transactions` directory.\n   - `context.submit_tx(signed_tx.to_cbor())`: This submits the transaction to the Cardano blockchain in CBOR (Concise Binary Object Representation) format.\n\nOverall, this script is designed to create and submit a transaction that involves an oracle. The transaction includes a specific amount of ADA, a datum with oracle-related information, and a validity period. The transaction is signed by the oracle's private key and submitted to the blockchain.", "file_path": "opshin-smart-contract-examples/vesting_oracle_fee/oracle/publish.py", "file": "publish.py"}

The code demonstrates how to define and serialize a custom datum structure for use in Cardano transactions. Let's break down the code step by step:\n\n### 1. Datum Structure Definition\n\nThe code begins with a comment that describes the structure of a custom datum called `Listing`. This structure is defined using a Python `dataclass` and inherits from `PlutusData`, which is a base class for data types used in Plutus smart contracts.\n\n```python\n@dataclass()\nclass Listing(PlutusData):\n    # Price of the listing in lovelace\n    price: int\n    # the owner of the listed object\n    vendor: Address\n    # whoever is allowed to withdraw the listing\n    owner: PubKeyHash\n```\n\n- **`price`**: An integer representing the price of the listing in lovelace (1 ADA = 1,000,000 lovelace).\n- **`vendor`**: An `Address` type representing the owner of the listed object.\n- **`owner`**: A `PubKeyHash` type representing the entity allowed to withdraw the listing.\n\n### 2. Importing Required Classes\n\nThe code imports necessary classes from a module named `examples.smart_contracts.marketplace`. These classes are used to construct the `Listing` datum.\n\n```python\nfrom examples.smart_contracts.marketplace import (\n    Listing,\n    Address,\n    PubKeyCredential,\n    NoStakingCredential,\n)\n```\n\n- **`Listing`**: The custom datum class.\n- **`Address`**: Represents a Cardano address.\n- **`PubKeyCredential`**: Represents a public key credential.\n- **`NoStakingCredential`**: Represents the absence of a staking credential.\n\n### 3. Creating the Datum Instance\n\nAn instance of the `Listing` datum is created with specific values.\n\n```python\ndatum = Listing(\n    5000000,  # This price is in lovelace = 5 ADA\n    Address(\n        PubKeyCredential(\n            bytes.fromhex(\"f5b84180b5a3cca20052258fe73328c69ff8e0d41709505668101db7\")\n        ),\n        NoStakingCredential(),\n    ),\n    bytes.fromhex(\"f5b84180b5a3cca20052258fe73328c69ff8e0d41709505668101db7\"),\n)\n```\n\n- **`price`**: Set to 5,000,000 lovelace (5 ADA).\n- **`vendor`**: An `Address` object is created with a `PubKeyCredential` containing a public key hash and a `NoStakingCredential`.\n- **`owner`**: A public key hash, identical to the vendor's public key hash.\n\n### 4. Exporting the Datum\n\nThe datum is serialized into two formats: JSON and CBOR Hex.\n\n#### JSON Export\n\n```python\nprint(datum.to_json(indent=2))\n```\n\nThis outputs the datum in JSON format, which is human-readable and useful for integration with tools like `cardano-cli`. The JSON structure includes constructors and fields that represent the data in a structured way.\n\n#### CBOR Hex Export\n\n```python\nprint(datum.to_cbor(encoding=\"hex\"))\n```\n\nThis outputs the datum in CBOR (Concise Binary Object Representation) encoded as a hexadecimal string. CBOR is a binary format that is compact and efficient for on-chain storage and processing.\n\n### Summary\n\nThis code provides a clear example of how to define, instantiate, and serialize a custom datum for use in Cardano smart contracts. The `Listing` datum includes a price, a vendor address, and an owner public key hash, and it is serialized into both JSON and CBOR formats for use in transactions. This approach is essential for interacting with Cardano's extended UTXO model, where datums play a crucial role in smart contract logic.", "file_path": "opshin/examples/extract_datum.py", "file": "extract_datum.py"}
